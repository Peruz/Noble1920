 (1) The 00:00 GMT observation stores the previous day's accumulated rainfall.
 (2) Frozen precipitation is measured at the time of thaw.  Some snowmelt may never be observed due to factors including sublimation and blowing snow.
 (3) Data quality is frequently re-assessed.  On rare occasions, some quality assurance flags may change in the months following your data request.
